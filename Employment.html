			<h1>Employment:</h1>
			<hr>

			<p>Students go into university in hopes that getting an undergraduate degree will be worth getting a better job, but the myth that undergraduate degrees yield an additional $1 million has been debunked and students are finding a harder time getting into the job market. </p>
<p> Higher education no longer makes students stand out, in fact more than ever the need for higher education is more common than ever before to get many different entry level jobs. The Bc government predicts that by 2020, approximately 35 percent of new jobs will now require a university degree while 42 percent will require at least a college or trade certificate. </p>
<p> While this is all fine and dandy, the increasing risk for levels of debt at young ages is a vicious first step in being able to find yourself a job to pay it off. There has been an increase of students dropping out of school after hitting too much debt and finding they can’t find any work in order to start to pay it all off.  Unemployment in the youth is currently double compared to the overall unemployment rate, and that’s not even taking into consideration  the part time students seeking full time jobs or unpaid interns! </p>
