I went on to college anyway. I worked my way through it and paid my student loans for 11 years."</h2> <br> <h3>-Chandra Wilson </h3>

			<h1>Debt:</h1>
			<hr>

			<p> By the end of September 2010, the total of student debt exceeded nearly $15 billion dollars and its only continued to growing. </p>

			<p> The Canadian Federation of Students estimates that the average of student debt in almost $28,000! According to the Canadan Student Loan Program, most students end up taking almost 10 years to pay off their loans. </p> 

			<p> Not only does student debt effect how students live, this student debt also give students a lower net worth and are less likely to have saving or investments compared to debt-free peers.No longer can students just work in the summer to pay off tuition, now going to school is a active choice on if a person wants to spend there life in debt or not. Each year average tuition fees have only continued to rise to the point that soon only the rich will be able to pay for education with the fear of the middle class will never be able to pay back what they owe. </p>
