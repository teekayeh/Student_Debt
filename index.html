			<h3 >What do most students share in common?</h3>
			
			<p>
			Some might say something along the lines of a Netflixs account or the need for a good night’s sleep paired with a nutritious meal, but the facts are that most student’s theses day all share student debt in common. Post-secondary education is now a huge requirement to find success in the “real” world and find a successful job. As the demands and interest for education increases, help with funding hasn’t been able to help students in the slightest.

			<p>
			As talked about in “The Impact of Student Debt” written by Glenn Burley and Adam Awad, from 1990 to 2014 the national average tuition fees have seen an inflation-adjusted increase of over 155%. In Ontario, tuition fees have increased over 180%. For most students—often having spent little time fully active in the workforce—funding their education has become increasingly difficult. </p> 
			<p>
			The only way students can afford to go to school these days is to take on huge levels of student debt and even that starts to become increasing difficult task to take on. The broke student stereotype lives on even after education has ended.</p>
